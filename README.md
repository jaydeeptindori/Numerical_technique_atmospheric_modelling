The computational modelling a physical process requires the following steps: 
(a) Define your problem 
(b) Formulate the mathematical model
(c) Code and Computer Simulation.

The numerical approaches are required to solve any partial differential equation (PDE) are following:
### 1. FINITE DIFFERENCE METHOD


### 2. FINITE ELEMENT METHOD
### 3. FINITE VOLUME METHOD
