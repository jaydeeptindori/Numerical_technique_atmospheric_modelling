# Numerical_technique_atmospheric_modelling

The computational modelling a physical process requires the following steps: 
(a) Define your problem 
(b) Formulate the mathematical model
(c) Code and Computer Simulation.

The numerical approaches are required in atmospheric modelling are summerised here.
