The computational modelling a physical process requires the following steps: 
(a) Define your problem 
(b) Formulate the mathematical model
(c) Code and Computer Simulation.

The numerical approaches are required to solve any partial differential equation (PDE) are following:
### 1. FINITE DIFFERENCE METHOD
It tranfom the PDE into the difference equation using finite difference method. It is one of the oldest method to solve the difference equation using a local Taylor expansion. It is abbreviated as FDM. The square network of lines is used to discritized the PDE. This is a major problem with $ x^{2}$ This is a potential bottleneck of the method when handling complex geometries in multiple dimensions. This issue motivated the use of an integral form
of the PDEs and subsequently the development of the finite element and finite
volume techniques.

### 2. FINITE ELEMENT METHOD
### 3. FINITE VOLUME METHOD
